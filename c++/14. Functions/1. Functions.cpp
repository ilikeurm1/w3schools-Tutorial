	A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.

	You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.

	Functions are used to perform certain actions, and they are important for reusing code: Define the code once, and use it many times.


	Create a Function
	C++ provides some pre-defined functions, such as main(), which is used to execute code. 
	But you can also create your own functions to perform certain actions.

	To create (often referred to as declare) a function, specify the name of the function, followed by parentheses ():
	void myFunction() {
		// code to be executed
	}

	Example Explained
	myFunction() is the name of the function
	void means that the function does not have a return value. You will learn more about return values later in the next chapter
	inside the function (the body), add code that defines what the function should do
	
	
	Call a Function
	Declared functions are not executed immediately. 
	They are "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when they are called.

	To call a function, write the function's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon ;

	In the following example, myFunction() is used to print a text (the action), when it is called:	
	*/

	myFunction(); // call the function

	// Outputs "I just got executed!"

	return 0;
}
