# C++ Guide by [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/)

## What is in this Folder?

This folder holds (for now) part of the w3schools guide on c++.

But I will be adding every part when I'm finished.

## Structure

Every part of the guide is in a folder with the name of the part. In each folder, there are the files that are in the guide (they are also called the same as on the website).

So the layout of this folder is the same as the layout of the guide on the website.

There is also a [Template](Template.cpp) file that holds the template I used in the tutorial.
